# Home Hydroponics ðŸŒ± ðŸ’§

Tidbits from our first adventure with hydroponic farming/gardening, starting with a vertical tower garden.  

<!--more-->

After watching few videos and a little reading decided the [vertical tower gardens](https://search.brave.com/images?q=hydroponic%20tower) 
looked like the coolest way to grow some vegetables. Vertical tower hydroponics have various advantages over traditional 
crop production methods including:
* High density yield for a small area
* Year around production inside
* Can provide more than 90 percent efficiency in water use

There are a bunch of pre-made vertical tower gardens available, but it could be more cost-effective to build them and 
thankfully there are tons of DIY designs for vertical hydroponic gardens available. The DIY design we've been 
experimenting with at the Funky Farm is a [free](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) set of 3d printable 
files that are modular pieces that connect together to make the tower, [The Modular Hydroponic Tower Garden](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3405964)

To get started we went to a local nursery and got baby tomatoes, basil, cilantro, green peppers, jalapeÃ±os, kale, mint,
and spearmint. We took the plants out of the pots and rinsed the dirt away from the roots before dropping them into the 
3d printed planting pots using Hydroton (Expanded Clay Pebbles) to hold the plants and roots. The clay pebbles are 
great for the tower, some advantages include:
* Maintains a neutral pH
* Retains some water
* Drains water well
* Environmentally friendly

## 1st Season Result

During our outdoor summer grow we had some issues with the basil, it picked up a black fungus, so we decided to harvest 
the plant to stop the spread. The only other plant that had an issue was the spearmint, we noticed it growing out of 
another plant pot and when we looked inside we could see the roots were spreading across the tower garden to other plant 
pots.

The crop that kept giving all season was cilantro. It seemed about every couple weeks or so we'd be harvesting it for 
our fresh salsa.
